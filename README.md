# README

Weather Watchers is currently in development!

If you would like to see where the project currently stands and see the progress made along the way please fork and clone this repository to your local machine and follow the steps below...

Open the codes base in your preffered code editor, open a terminal window, and run the following command to download necessary rails dependencies:

    $ bundle install
    
Next we need to run the following in order to install React dependencies:

    $ npm install --prefix client
    
Now we can begin to launch the application, in the terminal run:

    $ rails s

After launching the rails server, open an additional terminal window and run the following command to launch the React portion of the application:

    $ npm start --prefix client



Hope you enjoy fellow Weather Watchers!
